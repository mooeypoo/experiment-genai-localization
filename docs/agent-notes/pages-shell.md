# Pages & Shell

## Content consolidation (canonical copy)

Landing page and About page copy were consolidated and standardized across experiments (Cursor/Sonnet and Copilot). Both pages now use the same canonical text: the landing page explains the experiment, how to use the site, and links to both assistant versions; the About page describes the experiment structure, why localization and incremental design were chosen, how the site works, and limitations. The title on the landing page is driven by `viewer.config` (`assistantName`) so each deployment can show the correct assistant name. Layout, routing, step logic, and shell (including footer) were preserved.
